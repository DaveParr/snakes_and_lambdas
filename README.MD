## Solves
* productionising python data science 
* micro-service for data science
* local code -> cloud deployment workflow

## Requires
* to generate the slides, use [`revelation`](https://pypi.org/project/revelation/)

## Contributions
I wrote and compiled all the material and the experience that drove it, however I have also been able to use a vast wealth of other peoples resources they have shared on the topic. These are clearly linked and I encourage you to go and dive deeper into those resources. Without those resources I would not have been able to implement any of the material described here.
